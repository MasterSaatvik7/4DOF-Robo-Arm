# 4DOF-Robo-Arm
This Robot Arm was developed as a Project for Display in the Robotic Expo conducted by VIT Chennai's Robotics Department.
The concept of this project has been taken from the video on How To Mechatronics' video "DIY Arduino Robot Arm with Smartphone Control" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_B3gWd3A_SI
The 3D Files for Arm were taken from video description as it is.
The working code has been provided in this repo. Note: It is a hard code for our project.
The components used in this project are: Arduino UNO, SG90 Servo Motors, Nema 17 stepper motor, L298N Motor Driver for the Stepper Motor.
